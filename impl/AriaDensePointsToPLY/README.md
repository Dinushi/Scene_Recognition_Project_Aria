### python code for the ply creation
(Note: python's format of .ply creation might not support the PCL method of reading point clouds. I could not successfully read xyz points from the .ply files written using python open3D during the frustum culling in C++ filter)
## Update the aria_data.json file with the folder path of aria data
## Update the aria_data.json file with the folder path that you need to write new ply data

# run the script as :
    python3 generate_PLY_from_dense_points.py aria_data.json

# This will create ply files for all the scenes in the aria dataset you select

### C++ implementation (ReaderUsingC)
(Note: since the python version of .ply did not support PCL, I used a seperate project inside that to do the smae using C++ and PCL, The .ply files generated by this code only supports the frustum culling filter)

cd ReaderUsingC
./run_build_commands.sh

# update the configs as required here and run
./run_ply_generation.sh
